Welcome to Lean!

The documentation for all Lean assets is inside the root of each directory.

For example, for Lean Touch you can find it in: "Lean/Touch/DOCUMENTATION.html".

Keep in mind the documentation is in HTML format, so you will need to open it in a web browser.

You can also open the documentation by clicking the "Documentation" icon at the top right of any Lean component.

Enjoy!
